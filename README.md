# A little overview:

### The game is, at first, a simple MVP to define the final project of INF01202.

#### - Main base:
  ###### It is fully based on the PvZ concept. A simple tower defense game that is easy to understand, despite having a lot of underlying logic.

#### - Goal:
  ###### To prepare the students for the challenge of dealing with a big project. Applying the concepts learned in the course and facing the inherent challenges of building a game with _less simple_ features.
